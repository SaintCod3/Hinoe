      Notice the use of %PUBLIC_URL% in the tags above.
      It will be replaced with the URL of the `public` folder during the build.
      Only files inside the `public` folder can be referenced from the HTML.

      Unlike "/favicon.ico" or "favicon.ico", "%PUBLIC_URL%/favicon.ico" will
      work correctly both with client-side routing and a non-root public URL.
      Learn how to configure a non-root public URL by running `npm run build`.

      I hear the drums echoing tonight
      But she hears only whispers of some quiet conversation
      She's coming in, 12:30 flight
      The moonlit wings reflect the stars that guide me towards salvation
      I stopped an old man along the way
      Hoping to find some old forgotten words or ancient melodies
      He turned to me as if to say, "Hurry boy, it's waiting there for you"
